# AdventofCode2020
Hello, this is my first time participating in Advent of Code! I code everything in C++.

The goal was to 
* solve it as quickly as possible when the question was released (depending on my schedule)
* modify it afterwards to add comments, clarification and maybe adopt some design patterns that I learnt
